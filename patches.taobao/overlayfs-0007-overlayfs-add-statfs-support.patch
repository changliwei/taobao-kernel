Subject: [PATCH 7/11] overlayfs: add statfs support
Patch-mainline: in house patch

Add support for statfs to the overlayfs filesystem.  As the upper layer
is the target of all write operations assume that the space in that
filesystem is the space in the overlayfs.  There will be some inaccuracy as
overwriting a file will copy it up and consume space we were not expecting,
but it is better than nothing.

Use the upper layer dentry and mount from the overlayfs root inode,
passing the statfs call to that filesystem.
